1. **MSI Afterburner** - For CPU/GPU/RAM monitoring
   - Download: [MSI Afterburner Official Site](https://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner)

2. **RivaTuner Statistics Server (RTSS)** - For FPS monitoring
   - Included with MSI Afterburner installation
   - Must be running for FPS monitoring to work

3. **Loupedeck Software** - Version 6.0 or higher
   - Download: [Loupedeck Official Site](https://loupedeck.com/)

2. Double click on the lplug4 and install it

### Option 2: Build from Source
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PCMonitorPlugin.git
   cd PCMonitorPlugin
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet build src/PCMonitorPlugin.csproj
   ```

3. The plugin will be automatically deployed to your Loupedeck plugins folder

## Usage

### Available Actions

#### System Monitors
Add these widgets to your Loupedeck layout for continuous monitoring:

- **CPU Monitor** - Shows CPU load (%), temperature (Â°C), and power (W)
- **GPU Monitor** - Shows GPU load (%), temperature (Â°C), and power (W)
- **RAM Monitor** - Shows RAM usage in GB
- **FPS Monitor** - Shows current FPS from the active game

#### FPS App Selector
Use this folder to manually select which application to monitor for FPS:

1. Add the "Select FPS App" folder to your layout
2. Press to open and see all running applications detected by RTSS
3. Select the game you want to monitor
4. The FPS Monitor will now track only that application
5. Select "Auto Mode" to return to automatic detection

### Configuration

The plugin works out of the box with default settings. Make sure:

1. **MSI Afterburner** is running with hardware monitoring enabled
2. **RivaTuner Statistics Server** is running
3. In-game overlay is enabled in RTSS for FPS detection

### Troubleshooting

**No data displayed:**
- Check that MSI Afterburner and RTSS are running
- Verify that hardware monitoring is enabled in MSI Afterburner
- Check the Loupedeck logs for detailed error messages

**FPS shows wrong application:**
- Use the "Select FPS App" folder to manually choose the correct process
- Some games launch through clients (e.g., League of Legends) - select the actual game process

**Metrics not updating:**
- Restart MSI Afterburner
- Restart the Loupedeck service
- Check Windows Task Manager to verify processes are running
